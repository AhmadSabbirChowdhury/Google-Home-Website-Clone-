It is a clone of google home website. It is a fully responsive mobile first web page.
It is a very elegant looking clone of google home webpage. To make it responsive I used HTML/CSS framewrok Bootstrap.
I added scrolling effect in this webpage using jQuery and css animation.
The navbar collapse when it is in mobile or tab view. For mobile and tab view I added a hamburger-menu.
Later I will upload another project where I used this same web template and made a functionable contact form using PHP
